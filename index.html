      <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Your Image" id="Eli">

      <p>I was born the year "Thriller" by Michael Jackson was #1, and the Times Man of the Year was the "Computer." I suppose it is only fitting now after 30 something years I chose to embark on the <br>journey to become a developer.
        In between the year I was born and now, I made it through adolences, graduated highshool, completed 8 years in the <br>Marine Corps and had a few jobs in the healthcare industry. I am excited to see what the next 30 something years holds</p>
